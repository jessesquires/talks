# [fit] swift __*evolution*__

> The Swift evolution process aims to leverage the collective ideas, insights, and experience of the Swift community to improve the Swift development experience.

1. *Engage community*
2. *Maintain vision and conceptual coherence*
3. *Core team responsible for strategic direction*

---
In other words...

# [fit] Turn our[^*] __*ideas*__
# [fit] Into Improvements

![fit](../../img/swift-logo.png)

[^*]: *Anyone can participate!*

# [fit] Make __*Swift*__ Great Again

# [fit] How did we get here?

Finally, *Swift 3.0* has arrived! ðŸ˜Ž

But *how* did that happen? ðŸ¤”

Let's *analyze* swift-evolution proposals! ðŸ¤“

^I wrote a bunch of scripts!

# [fit] Swift __*3.0*__

*1012% more swiftyâ„¢*

![fit](../../img/swift-logo.png)

---

# __*Goals*__

- Stable ABI (Application Binary Interface)
- Resilience
- Portability
- Type system cleanup and docs
- Complete generics
- Focus and refine language
- API design guidelines

*Swift 3:*
*Nothing compiles*

Swift 3:
Even Tim Cook was like `Â¯\_(ãƒ„)_/Â¯`

![original](img/cook-change.jpg)

^Tim Cook thought he was talking about the new iPhone but he was really talking about Swift 3

*__Overwhelming__ community participation!*

# [fit] _Proposals **everywhere**_

![](../../img/everywhere.jpeg)

^75% of all proposals were accepted for Swift 3

---

# New Goals

- *API design guidelines*
    - Automatic application of naming guidelines to imported Objective-C APIs
    - Adoption of naming guidelines in key APIs
    - Swiftification of imported Objective-C APIs
- *Focus and refine language*
- Improvements to tooling quality

*(a.k.a Source Stability)*

# [fit] The cost of Swift Evolution

# [fit] __*Opportunity*__
# [fit] __*Cost*__
# [fit] what did we give up?

^Most of Swift 3's original goals!
^Novelty effect
^Necessary evil
^But source stability is extremely important

---

# [fit] __*What is worth it?*__

# [fit] `Source stability >> ABI stability`

---

# Finally...
# Behind every
# proposal
# is an __*author*__ ðŸ’ª

^It is a lot of work to push a proposal forward
^Write formal proposal, discuss on mailing list

# Authors

# Other Stats?

- avg time for review, longest, shortest

- avg # authors per proposal

- core team vs community proposals

- avg # proposals per author, top influencers?

- types of proposals: bug, syntax refinement, feature refinement, new feature
