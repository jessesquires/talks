# Swift Summit 2016

Pushing the limits of protocol oriented programming

> All programming languages have their own "personality" and encourage certain paradigms. In Swift, this is expressed through protocol-oriented programming and a focus on value types. As a community, we convey this by describing code as being "swifty" or not. In this talk, we'll examine how we can push the limits of protocol-oriented programming (and thus, the limits of the Swift type-checker) by building a generic, protocol-oriented ("swifty") data source framework.
