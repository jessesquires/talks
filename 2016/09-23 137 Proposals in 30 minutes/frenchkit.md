*137 proposals in 30 minutes*

> Swift 3.0 was an exciting release that dramatically changed the language. It was the first major release cycle that was started and finished in the open. With tremendous feedback from the open source community, the language was refined through the Swift Evolution process with 137 proposals! It’s easy to get lost in all the changes. This talk reviews and evaluates each proposal, answering why and how we arrived where we are today, and whether or not we’re better off.
